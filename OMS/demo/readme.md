#### Background

The objectives of the demo environment and these instructions, is to guide you through some relevant scenarios to showcase the strength of the OMS components, individually and combined.
In short, these are the goals:

* Teach you how to demo OMS in a way that is relevant to your customer
* Modular demos that we will show knit together that you can customize
* Use an environment that is maintained for you
* Give you confidence to run a PoC or to build a custom demo environment for your customer

##### Pre-reqs

* Access to the Azure subscription where OMS demo environment is deployed

##### Roadmap

* Resource Manager templates for deploying the same demo environment and its scenarios into your own Azure subscription will be released in CY 2017
* Add Service Map, Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor and Application Insights to the storyline
